#### Summary & Key Take Aways:
John Tully speaks of not only the advancements made in wired technology, but also of the devastation this growth caused in "A VIctorian Ecological DIsaster: Imperialism, the Telegraph and Gutta-Percha".  The growth from flags and physically carrying the message to wires that do the carrying for you came with a great ecological cost as not only did areas need to be cleared for these wires but also a specific resource was need to protect them, one that was already stretched thin by consumers. This echos modern day network expansion with more area and resources being taken up by [[The Nerves]] that connect internet dwelling nations together and are still expanding.
