#### Summary & Key Take Aways:
In "Introduction: Media as Historical Subjects" Lisa Gitelman talks of how the the advent of the internet and specifically the media that take host within it is a new phenemina about how people are experiencing it and how it is being studied in the historical sense. She sets a murky definition of what media is while also talking about the trials it poses as new history. It lends itself to the idea of [[The Underbelly]] of the internet where below the mainstream, easily acessable data, there is much much more knowledge and history hiding in the murky depths, lost to the tides or inaccesible through normal means.
