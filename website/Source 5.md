[[Introduction= Media as Historical Subjects]]

### Gitelman.pdf

“This book examines the ways that media—and particularly new media—are experienced and studied as historical subjects.”              New media is definitly being consumed by younger and younger audiences

“"The Case of Phonographs" against "The Question of the Web," and thereby challenge readers to imagine what a meaningful history of today's”           Radio is an early form of internet? allows the transmitting of data through indirect(?) means and the vast proliferation of set data

“So one refers to what "the Media" is doing in the same spirit that one might refer to what "Big Oil" is up to or how the NASDAQ is performing this month”                      This has only become more and more prevelant since the writing of the article

“It is a medium”              Like the page is

“It pays to be careful with language”              We have seen the opposite of this happen with the general population on the internet, opting for inpercise communication in favour of speed

“yet media seem to be hard to talk or write about with much precision. For that reason, I begin here by working out a broad definition of media before offering an introduction to both the specific case of early recorded sound, and my larger argument about media and doing media history.”                 The media is the means through which the world is filtered through biases and transmitted to individuals

“Distributed digital networks have long been described as the ultimate medium in another sense: collectively, they are the medium that can survive thermonuclear war.”                 They have foundations deeper than typical entites, look at scene groups for example

“Media muddy the map. Like old art, old media remain meaningful. Think of medieval manuscripts, eight-track tapes, and rotary phones, or semaphores, stereoscopes, and punchcard programming: only antiquarians use them, but they are all recognizable as media. Yet like old science, old media also seem unacceptably unreal. Neither silent film nor black-and-white television seems right anymore, except as a throwback. Like acoustic (nonelectronic) analog recordings, they just don't do the job. The "job" in question is largely though not exclusively one of representation, and a lot of the muddiness of media as historical subjects arises from their entanglement with this swing term.”      
The underbelly of the media, electronic media and by extent the internet is akin the navigating the deep sea with no light, full of niche groups with closed doors and unknow/unnamed orgs

“media may be as the scientific instruments of a society at large”                 Media is less scientific and more of the opposite, emotional and driven by passion and ideas and heart ect, very little is scientific

“I define media as socially realized structures of communication”               How socially realized? whats the break point where something becomes media

“Consumer demand was decisive, I agree, but part of my argument is that the very categories of consumer and producer are inadequate to explain fully the deep definition of new media. When media are new, when their protocols are still emerging and the social, economic, and material relationships they will eventually express are still in formation, consumption and production can be notably indistinct.”                Consumer demand and practices are such a drving force behind media that some of the most powerful people now stand ontop of empires sole built upon this

“Part of this res- could "i onance is superficial, but part of it involves the idea of history itself what it means to graph s experience a sense of history or historical fact, what it means to write the early history from n of anything, and what the histories of media specifically involve.
