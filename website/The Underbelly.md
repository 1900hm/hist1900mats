Much of the internet is unreachable through normal means, there are many pockets on data, history, even organizations or other groups hidden in this underbelly, from torrenting groups to just groups that dont have a pubic front. This is somewhat touched upon in [[Introduction= Media as Historical Subjects]] where the idea that media as a form is murky and somewhat undefinable with hard to catagorize, this rings true in multiple senses as due to the fact much of the internet is unreachable it cannot be catagorized and even by its very nature the internet is murky even if its purely for the amount of information.
