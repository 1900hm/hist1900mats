#### Summary & Key Take Aways:
Wayne Wiegand touches upon where the Dewey Decimal Classifiacation stems from in "The Amherst Method: The Origin os the Dewey Decimal CLassification Scheme", focusing on where Dewey draws inspiration for ideas from and the myriad of different people that had some influence on how the Scheme was formed. This topic of [[Originality]] is especially relevent with the modern internet and the same problems can be traced back through its history, what is inspiration and what is stealing, where is the line drawn and who feels the effect of it the most?
