#### Summary & Key Take Aways:
What Bonnie Mak talks about in "How the Page Matters" isnt just why a page is important in the context of our world and our society, but what exactly a page is. The definition is less firm than you would think with the image of a a white sheet of paper coming to mind. A page is a means to transmit the ideas, cultures, traditions and information of people from their mind onto a physical object. The form of this [[Medium]] has changed over time ranging from papyrus to the digital but each form still holds an important, underdiscovered role in transmitting thought.
