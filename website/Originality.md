Originality in the day and age of the internet is disapearing. Whether intentional or not more and more information and content are overlapping and it becomes unclear if things are being taken as inspiration or being ripped off. We see an example of this in [[The ''Amherst Method'' =The Origins of the Dewy Decimal CLassification Scheme]] where Dewey pulls inspiration from the world around him, almost to the point of being plagarism. This only becomes easier the further and further the internet develops and deepens around us, possibly further this problem even more in the future.
