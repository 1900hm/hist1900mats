# Why tut level is important
In my opinion the Tutorial Level is important to the course as a whole for two main reasons. First it helps students set up the required programs that they will be using 
whithout wasting lecture time on this process. Secondly it helps students who have no or very little expirience in this kind of activity dip their toes into the field
while also creating a way for the prof to recive needed information about the students in their class both in terms of interests/comfort as well as account names.
